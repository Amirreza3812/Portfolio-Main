    "mainText": "Hi! I'm a UI/UX designer and front-end developer with a passion for creating thoughtful, user-centered digital experiences. My design process begins in Figma, where I focus on building clean, intuitive interfaces. On the development side, I work with React and Angular, and I’m currently diving deeper into Next.js to explore server-side rendering and advanced front-end capabilities. While front-end is my main focus, I’ve also built and deployed back-end features using Express.js, mainly to bring my own projects to life. I’m currently learning more about networking fundamentals to deepen my understanding of how the web really works. I’m not attached to any particular framework or technology — for me, the best tool is the one that fits the problem. I'm always curious, always learning, and always striving to improve my skills across the stack — including future goals like exploring 3D web design. Beyond buildingprojects, I also work as a mentor, helping others learn front-end development and guiding them through the challenges of their learning journey. My goal? To keep growing, keep building, and keep creating products that are both beautiful and functional.",
